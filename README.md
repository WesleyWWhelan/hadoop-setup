# HADOOP Installation and Setup

### First - Install Hombrew:
https://brew.sh/

## Open Terminal Window:

### Second - Install Java:

`$ brew install java`

#### Check version: 

`$ java -version` 
(Should be 1.8)

#### Install JDK

`$ brew install adoptopenjdk8`

### Third - Install Hadoop:

`$ brew install hadoop`

* This will be at the path: /usr/local/Cellar/hadoop and should be version 3.3.0 as of today (Nov 23, 2020) *

### Fourth - Changes to files:

I prefer to open up the file itself in my editor (I use VSCode), so I use:

`$ cd /usr/local/Cellar/hadoop`

to access the file from terminal, and then:

`$ code .`

to open it in VSCode. Otherwise, you could do:

`$ cd /usr/local/Cellar`

to access the file from terminal, and then:

`$ open hadoop`

#### Now that it is open, we can access the specific files we need to edit.

In this repo, there are four files in the "changes" folder. Replace the files in hadoop on your computer, with these four files. Optionally, you could just copy the code out and replace the code instead of downloading the files.

### Remove need for password:

`
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -P '' -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
$ chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
`
